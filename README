Script to list, start, stop and restore the latest snapshot of build vms.

You have to download and install vSphere SDK for Perl
https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/viperltoolkit/

The script contains no build logic but assumes to be run by your build scripts
to start and stop build vms and - if you do set up your environment in this way
- to restore the build vm to a clean state after a unsuccessful build.

If you do want to use the restore functions, don't forget to make a snapshot
after installing the build-tools and dev-libs, configuring your proxy-settings,
etc.

Move 'vmware_cmd.conf' to '.vmware_cmd.conf' in your build users home directory.
